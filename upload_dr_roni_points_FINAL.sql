There are many opinions regarding the meaning of  “Bai Huan Shu”. Why would it be referred to as jade gate? It seems unreasonable that such a precious stone would be associated with this part of the body? Some are of the opinion that “Bai” - white is a reference to the metal element that serves the function of drawing boundaries. This being one of the lower boundaries of the body. The anus and vagina as lower orifices have a crucial task of preserving pure substances and releasing those that are not needed. With that in mind one can concur that BL30 is the Shu point of the anus and vagina.

Basic rules and contraindications for acupuncture
In the following instances one should exercise caution before deciding to use acupuncture and be meticulous in choosing acupuncture points.
In cases of exhaustion and fatigue it is preferable to support the patient with moxa on St36 and/or Cv6
If the patient has been fasting there is risk of fainting. It is preferable to eat 30 minutes before receiving acupuncture after a prolonged fast.
Do not needle after a heavy meal or if the patient feels stuffed.
Exercise caution in needling when the patient is experiencing an extreme emotional state, e.g. joy or sadness. Needling in these circumstances may result in reverse flow of CHI.
Immediately after conception, acupuncture should only be done by a doctor who understands the process of pregnancy from conception through birth and the unique changes in the patterns of CHI flow which take place during this process.
6. Do not needle in instances where there is dissonance between the complexion and the pulse in terms of pattern diagnostics. This shows an energetic imbalance. Breathing techniques should be used to regain balance before using acupuncture.
When the weather does not support the treatment, e.g. in extremely stormy weather avoid strong needle stimulation especially when treating acute pathologies. In extreme heat, do not use moxa.
When the time of the treatment does not support the treatment, e.g. during the evening and night time avoid strong needle stimulation unless the pathology is strong and acute.
PREGNANCY
The process of pregnancy is one of upmost importance. The physician must fully understand and support this physiologic '),
('CO4 is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. This is due to its strong yang quality which can cause contractions. For this same reason, it is also a very effective point during labor.', 'Liver', 'SP6 is contraindicated for the entire pregnancy because it is responsible for balancing the subtle environmental changes in the womb e.g. dampness and heat. Needling may disrupt this delicate balance.', 'Ren6 is contraindicated because of its location', ''),
('BL23 and DU4 are both contraindicated because of their locations. Also, DU4 has a strong energetic effect on the kidneys and BL23 has a strong connection with the DAI MAI, both systems should be used cautiously during pregnancy.', 'Liver', 'Additional Cautions', 'A pregnant woman who is very weak should not be needled.', 'Exercise extreme caution in treatment if the patient has a history of miscarriages
Do not needle a pregnant woman experiencing extreme emotional tension resulting in extreme anger, sadness or anxiety.
Do not needle a pregnant woman suffering extreme acute pain in the upper or lower abdomen.
Points Forbidden During Pregnancy

During a treatment where and extraordinary meridian is opened, the use of other points on that meridian is contraindicated (see intro to extraordinary points).
The duration of needle retention is calculated per the time of day and what organ is dominant at the time of treatment. The practitioner should wait to feel 3 peaks in the pulse of the dominant organ, upon feeling the 3rd, needles are removed e.g. at noon one should wait to feel 3 peaks in the heart pulse. After the 3rd peak is felt, remove the needles in the correct order.

There are 12 Mu points found on the body, one for each organ. These points have a yin nature and therefore influence the physical aspect of their associated organs. Another sign of these being yin in nature is their location. All of them are found on the anterior aspect of the body (chest, upper and lower abdomen). They are crucial points to influence the body’s function. The Mu points are used to influence the building of yin material of their associated organ.

The Clock
The use of opposites on the Chinese clock is known as “mid-day -mid night”. This is a fundamental law giving us insight to the energetic changes which occur throughout the day.  This principle is rooted in seeing the dynamic balance in cycles of energy. The 24-hour day is divided in to 12 hours of yang dominance (12:00-00:00) and 12 hours of yin dominance (00:00-12:00). Bearing in mind the principle of polarity of yin and yang, the Chinese clock shows us that when an organ is at its energetic peak, another organ (its clock opposite) is experiencing an energetic ebb e.g. at 12:00 pm the heart is at its peak. At the same time gall bladder is experiencing its ebb. This reciprocal waxing and waning of yin and yang is constantly taking place. Clinically this is a very important principle to consider, in that if we tonify an organ we also suppress its clock opposite. During a treatment, one must consider the system being needled and the system that is dominant at the time of the treatment as well as the opposites of each. The reason for this is that if we support an organ in treatment, we can potent'),
