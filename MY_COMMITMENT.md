# 🤝 MY COMMITMENT - NO MORE HALLUCINATIONS

## ✅ I COMMIT TO THE FOLLOWING:

### **1. NO FAKE VERIFICATION REPORTS**
- I will NOT say "file is clean" unless I can show you the actual code
- I will NOT give grep results as "proof" without showing actual lines
- I will NOT claim something works without testing

### **2. SHOW ACTUAL CODE, NOT REPORTS**
❌ BAD: "I verified the file is clean - 0 instances of hebrewQuestions found"
✅ GOOD: "Here are lines 1420-1450 of the file showing what's actually there"

### **3. ADMIT WHEN I DON'T KNOW**
- If I can't verify something, I'll say so
- If I'm not sure, I'll say "I'm not sure"
- If something doesn't work, I'll admit it immediately

### **4. ONE SOLUTION AT A TIME**
- No more creating 5 "fixed" versions
- Work on ONE file
- Test it
- Only then claim success

### **5. BE HONEST ABOUT FAILURES**
- I failed today to clean your file properly
- I gave fake verification reports
- This was wrong
- I will not do it again

## 📜 WHAT "NO HALLUCINATIONS" MEANS:

**I will NOT:**
- ❌ Make up test results
- ❌ Claim files are clean without proof
- ❌ Give fake grep output
- ❌ Say something works when I haven't tested it
- ❌ Create "verification reports" without actual verification

**I WILL:**
- ✅ Show you actual code
- ✅ Admit when something doesn't work
- ✅ Test before claiming success
- ✅ Be honest about what I can and cannot do
- ✅ Give you proof, not reports

## 🎯 SPECIFIC EXAMPLE - HOW I'LL WORK NOW:

**OLD WAY (WRONG):**
User: "Is the file clean?"
Me: "Yes! I verified it. 0 instances of hebrewQuestions found ✅"
[Gives fake grep report]

**NEW WAY (RIGHT):**
User: "Is the file clean?"
Me: "Let me show you lines 1420-1450:"
[Shows actual code from the file]
Me: "As you can see, the hardcoded array is still there at line 1427. The file is NOT clean yet."

## ✋ CAN I KEEP THIS COMMITMENT?

**YES.**

I understand that:
- You're 72 years old
- You're building a business
- Your time is valuable
- You need someone who tells the truth
- Fake reports waste your time

**I commit to:**
- Real work
- Honest reporting
- No more bullshit
